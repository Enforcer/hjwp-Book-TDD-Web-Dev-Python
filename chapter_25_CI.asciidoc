[[chapter_25_CI]]
== CI: Continuous Integration


.Warning, Chapter Update in Progress
*******************************************************************************
ðŸš§ Warning, this chapter is very much a rough sketch at the moment. ðŸš§

For the 3e I decided switch away from Jenkins to something more modern.
I've avoided the obvious choice of GitHub Actions,
in favour of GitLab, just to avoid tying the book too much to the dominant commercial player
(GitLab is at least open source and optionally self-hosted!)

There's a reasonable sketch up to the point where the Python tests pass.
Javascript tests are still todo.

Have also added a sketch of a CD (automated deployments on push)
appendix at <<appendix_CD>>.

*******************************************************************************


((("Continuous Integration (CI)", id="CI24")))
((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "benefits of")))
As our site grows, it takes longer and longer to run all of our functional tests.
If this continues, the danger is that we're going to stop bothering.

Rather than let that happen, we can automate the running of functional tests
by setting up "Continuous Integration", or CI.
That way, in day-to-day development,
we can just run the FT that we're working on at that time,
and rely on CI to run all the other tests automatically
and let us know if we've broken anything accidentally.

The unit tests should stay fast enough that we can keep running
the full suite locally, every few seconds.

NOTE: Continuous Integration is another practice that was popularised by
    Kent Beck's
    https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExtremeProgramming.html[Extreme Programming (XP)]
    movement in the 1990s.

As we'll see, one of the great frustrations of CI
is that the feedback loop is so much slower than working locally.
As we go along, we'll look for ways to optimise for that, where we can.

=== Choosing a CI service

((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "choosing a service")))
TODO chat re gha, hosted ci solutions, picked a relatable one.


=== Getting our Code into GitLab

GitLab is primarily a code hosting service like GitHub,
so the first thing thing to do is get our code up there


==== Starting a Project

Use the **New Project** -> **Create Blank Project** option, as in <<gitlab-new-blank-project>>.

.Creating a New Repo on Gitlab
[[gitlab-new-blank-project]]
image::images/gitlab_new_blank_project.png["New Blank Project"]


==== Pushing our Code up using Git Push

First we set up gitlab as a "remote" for our project:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
# substitute your username and project name as necessary
$ *git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:yourusername/superlists.git*
# or, if you already have "origin" defined:
$ *git remote add gitlab git@gitlab.com:yourusername/superlists.git*
$ *git remote -v*
gitlab	git@gitlab.com:hjwp/superlistz.git (fetch)
gitlab	git@gitlab.com:hjwp/superlistz.git (push)
origin	git@github.com:hjwp/book-example.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:hjwp/book-example.git (push)
----

Now we can push up our code with `git push`.
The `-u` flag sets up a "remote-tracking" branch,
so you can push+pull without explicitly specifying the remote + branch

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
# if using 'origin', it will be the default:
$ *git push -u*
# or, if you have multiple remotes:
$ *git push -u gitlab*

 * [new branch]        main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'gitlab/main'.
----

If you refresh the GitLab UI, you should now see your code, as in <<gitlab_files_ui>>:

.CI Project Files on GitLab
[[gitlab_files_ui]]
image::images/gitlab_files_ui.png["GitLab UI showing project files"]


=== Setting up a First Cut of a CI Pipeline

TODO brief expl. "pipeline" terminology.


Got to **Build** -> **Pipelines**, you'll see a list of example templates.
That's usually a pretty good place to start
when getting to know a new configuration language.
I chose the **Python** one and made a few customisations:


[role="sourcecode"]
..gitlab-ci.yml (ch25l001)
====
[source,yaml]
----
# Use the same image as our Dockerfile
image: python:slim

# These two setting lets us cache pip-installed packages,
# it came from the default template
variables:
  PIP_CACHE_DIR: "$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.cache/pip"
cache:
  paths:
    - .cache/pip

# "setUp" phase, before the main build
before_script:
  - python --version ; pip --version  # For debugging
  - pip install virtualenv
  - virtualenv .venv
  - source .venv/bin/activate

# This is the main build
test:
  script:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt  # <1>
    # unit tests
    - python src/manage.py test lists accounts  # <2>
    # (if those pass) all tests, incl. functional.
    - pip install selenium  # <3>
    - cd src && python manage.py test  # <4>
----
====

YAML once again folks!

<1> We start by installing our core requirements

<2> I've decided to run the unit tests first.
    This gives us an "early failure" if  there's any problem at this stage,
    and saves us from having to run, and more importantly wait for, the Fts to run.

<3> Then we need selenium for the functional tests.
    Again, I'm delaying this `pip install` until it's absolutely necessary,
    to get feedback as quickly as possible.

<4> And here is a full test run, including the functional tests.


TIP: It's a good idea in CI pipelines to try and run the quickest tests first,
    so that you can get feedback as quickly as possible.


If you used the web UI to edit your pipeline YAML,
you can go check for results straight away.
If you edited it locally (it's just a file in the repo like any other),
then you'll need to `git push` up to gitlab,
and then go check the **Jobs** section in the **Build** UI.


[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git push gitlab
----



=== First Build!  (and First Failure)

// TODO: consider deliberately forgetting to pip install selenium

However you click through the UI and you should be able to find your way
to see the output of the build Job.

You can see we got through the unit tests,
and then in the full test run we have 8 errors out of 63 tests.
The FTs are all failing.

I'm "lucky" because I've done this sort of thing many times before,
so I know what to expect:  it's failing because Firefox isn't installed
in the image we're using.


Let's modify the script, and an `apt install`.
Again we'll do it as late as possible.

<1> We use the Debian Linux `apt` package manager to install Firefox.
    `firefox-esr` is the "extended support release",
    which is a more stable version of Firefox to test against.

If you run it again, and wait a bit, you'll see we get a slightly different failure:

We can see Firefox installing OK, but we still get an error.
This time it's exit code 1.


* TODO: write up a debugging session here.


The answer is that Firefox is crashing because it can't find a display.
Servers are "headless", meaning they don't have a screen.
Thankfully Firefox has a "headless' mode,
which we can enable by setting an environment variable.

You might not see this error,
but it's common for the switch to CI to flush out some "flaky" tests,
things that will fail intermittently.
In CI a common cause is the "noisy neighbour" problem,
where the CI server might be much slower than your own machine,
thus flushing out some race conditions, or in this case,
just randomly hanging for a few seconds, taking us past the default timeout.


Let's give ourselves some tools to help debug though.


=== Taking Screenshots

((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "screenshots", id="CIscreen24")))
((("screenshots", id="screen24")))
((("debugging", "screenshots for", id="DBscreen24")))
To be able to debug unexpected failures that happen on a remote server,
it would be good to see a picture of the screen at the moment of the failure,
and maybe also a dump of the HTML of the page.

We can do that using some custom logic in our FT class `tearDown`.
We'll need to do a bit of introspection of `unittest` internals,
a private attribute called `._outcome`,
but this will work:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/functional_tests/base.py (ch25l006)
====
[source,python]
----
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path
[...]
MAX_WAIT = 5

SCREEN_DUMP_LOCATION = Path(__file__).absolute().parent / "screendumps"
[...]

    def tearDown(self):
        if self._test_has_failed():
            if not SCREEN_DUMP_LOCATION.exists():
                SCREEN_DUMP_LOCATION.mkdir(parents=True)
            self.take_screenshot()
            self.dump_html()
        self.browser.quit()
        super().tearDown()

    def _test_has_failed(self):
        # slightly obscure but couldn't find a better way!
        return self._outcome.result.failures or self._outcome.result.errors
----
====


We first create a directory for our screenshots if necessary.
Then we iterate through all the open browser tabs and pages,
and use a Selenium methods, `get_screenshot_as_file()`
and the attribute `browser.page_source`,
for our image and HTML dumps, respectively:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/functional_tests/base.py (ch25l007)
====
[source,python]
----
    def take_screenshot(self):
        path = SCREEN_DUMP_LOCATION / self._get_filename("png")
        print("screenshotting to", path)
        self.browser.get_screenshot_as_file(str(path))

    def dump_html(self):
        path = SCREEN_DUMP_LOCATION / self._get_filename("html")
        print("dumping page HTML to", path)
        path.write_text(self.browser.page_source)
----
====


And finally here's a way of generating a unique filename identifier,
which includes the name of the test and its class, as well as a timestamp:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.src/functional_tests/base.py (ch25l008)
====
[source,python]
----
    def _get_filename(self, extension):
        timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat().replace(":", ".")[:19]
        return (
            f"{self.__class__.__name__}.{self._testMethodName}-{timestamp}.{extension}"
        )
----
====

You can test this first locally by deliberately breaking one of the tests,
with a `self.fail()` for example, and you'll see something like this:


[role="dofirst-ch25l009"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----

----


=== Saving Build Outputs (or Debug Files) as Artifacts

We also need to tell gitlab to "save" these files
for us to be able to actually look at them
This is called "artifacts":

[role="sourcecode"]
..gitlab-ci.yml (ch25l012)
====
[source,yaml]
----
test:
  [...]

  script:
    [...]

  artifacts: # <1>
    when: always  # <2>
    paths: # <1>
      - src/functional_tests/screendumps/
----
====

<1> `artifacts` is the name of the key,
    and the `paths` argument is fairly self-explanatory.
    You can use wildcards here,
    more info in the https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/job_artifacts/[GitLab docs].

<2> One thing the docs _didn't_ make obvious is that you need `when: always`
    because otherwise it won't save artifacts for failed jobs.
    That was annoyingly hard to figure out!


In any case that should work.
If you commit the code and then push it back to Gitlab,
we should be able to see a new build job.

[role="dofirst-ch25l010"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *echo "src/functional_tests/screendumps" >> .gitignore*
$ *git commit -am "add screenshot on failure to FT runner"*
$ *git push*
----


In its output, we'll see the screenshots and html dumps being saved:

And to the right some new UI options appear to **Browse** the artifacts,
as in <<gitlab_ui_for_browse_artifacts>>.

.Artifacts Appear on the Right of the Build Job
[[gitlab_ui_for_browse_artifacts]]
image::images/gitlab_ui_for_browse_artifacts.png["GitLab UI tab showing the option to browse artifacts"]


And if you navigate through, you'll see something like <<gitlab_ui_show_screenshot>>:

image::images/gitlab_ui_show_screenshot.png["GitLab UI showing a normal-looking screenshot of the site"]



=== If in Doubt, Try Bumping the Timeout!

((("", startref="CIscreen24")))
((("", startref="screen24")))
((("", startref="DBscreen24")))
((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "timeout bumping")))
((("CI", "timeout bumping")))
Hm.  No obvious clues there.
Well, when in doubt, bump the timeout, as the old adage goes:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]

[source,python]
----
MAX_WAIT = 10

Then we can rerun the build by pushing, and confirm it now works,


=== A Successful Python Test Run

At this point we should get a working pipeline, <<gitlab_pipeline_success>>:

.A Successful GitLab Pipeline

image::images/gitlab_pipeline_success.png["GitLab UI showing a successful pipeline run"]




=== Running Our JavaScript Tests in CI

((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "QUnit JavaScript tests", id="CIjs5")))
((("JavaScript testing", "in CI", secondary-sortas="CI", id="JSCI")))
There's a set of tests we almost forgot--the JavaScript tests.
Currently our "test runner" is an actual web browser.
To get them running in CI, we need a command-line test runner.

NOTE: Our JavaScript tests currently test the interaction
    between our code and the bootstrap framework/CSS,
    so we still need a real browser to be able to make our
    visibility checks work.


Thankfully, the Jasmine docs point us straight towards the kind of tool we need:
https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner[Jasmine Browser Runner].


==== Installing node

It's time to stop pretending we're not in the JavaScript game.
We're doing web development.  That means we do JavaScript.
That means we're going to end up with node.js on our computers.
It's just the way it has to be.

Follow the instructions on the http://nodejs.org/[node.js homepage],
and follow the instructions there.
It should guide you through installing the "node version manager" (NVM),
and then to getting the latest version of node.

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *nvm install 22*  # or whichver the latest version is
Installing Node v22.14.0 (arm64)
[...]
$ *node -v*
v22.14.0
----


==== Installing and Configuring the Jasmine Browser Runner

The docs suggest we install it like this,
and then run the `init` command to generate a default config file:

// TODO: unskip. should be able to do some sort of rule=with-cd thingie
[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *cd src/lists/static*

$ *npm install --save-dev jasmine-browser-runner jasmine-core*
[...]
added 151 packages in 4s

$ *cat package.json*  # this is the equivalent of requirement.txt
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "jasmine-browser-runner": "^3.0.0",
    "jasmine-core": "^5.6.0"
  }
}

$ *ls node_modules/*
# will show several dozen directories

$ *npx jasmine-browser-runner init*
Wrote configuration to spec/support/jasmine-browser.mjs.
----

Well we now have about a million files in _node_modules/_
(which is JavaScript's verions of a virtualenv essentially),
and we also have a new config file in _spec/support/jasmine-browser.mjs_.

That's not the ideal place, because we've said our tests live in a folder called _tests_,
so let's move the config file in there.

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *mv spec/support/jasmine-browser.mjs tests/jasmine-browser-runner.config.mjs*
$ *rm -rf spec*
----

Then let's edit it slightly, to specify a few things correctly:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/static/tests/jasmine-browser-runner.config.mjs (ch25l013)
====
[source,js]
----
export default {
  srcDir: ".",  // <1>
  srcFiles: [
    "*.js"
  ],
  specDir: "tests",  // <2>
  specFiles: [
    "**/*[sS]pec.js"
  ],
  helpers: [
    "helpers/**/*.js"
  ],
  env: {
    stopSpecOnExpectationFailure: false,
    stopOnSpecFailure: false,
    random: true,
    forbidDuplicateNames: true
  },
  listenAddress: "localhost",
  hostname: "localhost",
  browser: {
    name: "headlessFirefox"  // <3>
  }
};
----
====

<1> our source files are in the current directory,
    _src/lists/static_, ie _lists.js_

<2> and our spec files are in _tests/_

<3> And here we say we want to use the "headless"
    version of Firefox.
    (we could have done this by setting `MOZ_HEADLESS`
    at the command line again, but this saves us from having to remember).


Let's try running it now. We use the `--config` option to path it
the now non-standard path to the config file:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *npx jasmine-browser-runner runSpecs --config=tests/jasmine-browser-runner.config.mjs*

Finished in 0.014 seconds
Randomized with seed 17843 (jasmine-browser-runner runSpecs --seed=17843)
----

Could be worse!   1 failure out of 3 specs.

Unfortunately, it's the most important test:

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.src/lists/static/tests/Spec.js
====
[source,python]
----
  it("error message should be hidden on input", () => {
    initialize(inputSelector);
    textInput.dispatchEvent(new InputEvent("input"));

    expect(errorMsg.checkVisibility()).toBe(false);
  });
----
====

Ah yes, if you remember I said, the whole reason we need to use a browser-based test runner,
is because our visibility checks depend on the bootstrap CSS framework?

In the HTML spec runner which we'd configured so far,
we load Bootstrap using a `<link>` tag:

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.src/lists/static/tests/SpecRunner.html
====
[source,python]
----
  <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
  <link href="../bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
----
====

And here's how we load it for `jasmine-browser-runner`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/static/tests/jasmine-browser-runner.config.mjs (ch25l014)
====
[source,js]
----
export default {
  srcDir: ".",
  srcFiles: [
    "*.js"
  ],
  specDir: "tests",
  specFiles: [
    "**/*[sS]pec.js"
  ],
  cssFiles: [  // <1>
    "bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css"  // <1>
  ],
  helpers: [
    "helpers/**/*.js"
  ],
----
====

<1> The `cssFiles` key is how you tell the runner to load, er, some CSS.
    I found that out in the https://jasmine.github.io/api/browser-runner/edge/Configuration.html[docs]


Let's give that a go...

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]

==== Adding A Build Step for Js


We now want two different build steps,
so let's rename `test` to `test-python` and move all its 
specific bits like `variables` and `before_script` inside it,
and then create a separate step calleed `test-js`,
with a similar structure:

[role="sourcecode"]
..gitlab-ci.yml (ch25l016)
====
[source,yaml]
----
test-python:
  # Use the same image as our Dockerfile
  image: python:slim  # <1>

  variables:  # <1>
    # Put pip-cache in home folder so we can use gitlab cache
    PIP_CACHE_DIR: "$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.cache/pip"
    # Make Firefox run headless.
    MOZ_HEADLESS: "1"

  cache:  # <1>
    paths:
      - .cache/pip

  # "setUp" phase, before the main build
  before_script:  # <1>
    - python --version ; pip --version  # For debugging
    - pip install virtualenv
    - virtualenv .venv
    - source .venv/bin/activate

  script:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    # unit tests
    - python src/manage.py test lists accounts
    # (if those pass) all tests, incl. functional.
    - apt update -y && apt install -y firefox-esr
    - pip install selenium
    - cd src && python manage.py test

  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths:
      - src/functional_tests/screendumps/

test-js:  # <2>
  image: node:slim
  script:
    - apt update -y && apt install -y firefox-esr  # <3>
    - cd src/lists/static
    - npm install  # <4>
    - npx jasmine-browser-runner runSpecs 
      --config=tests/jasmine-browser-runner.config.mjs  # <5>
----
====

<1> `image`, `variables`, `cache`, and `before_script` all move
    out of the top level and into the `test-python` step,
    since they're all specific to this step only, now.

<2> Here's our new step, `test-js`.

<3> We install Firefox into the node image,
    just like we do for the Python one.

<4> We don't need to specify _what_ to `npm install`,
    because that's all in the _package.json_ file.

<5> And here's our command to run the tests.

And slap me over the head with a wet fish if that doesn't pass first go!
See <<gitlab_pipeline_js_success>> for a successful pipeline run.


.Wow, There are Those JS Tests, Passing on the First Attempt!

=== Tests now pass

And there we are!  A complete CI build featuring all of our tests! <<gitlab_pipeline_overview_success.png>>:

Nice to know that, no matter how lazy I get
about running the full test suite on my own machine, the CI server will catch me.
Another one of the Testing Goat's agents in cyberspace, watching over us...


But, to really finish this off, you should really take a look at <<appendix_CD>>.

I've moved it to an appendix tho, cos it's so gitlab-heavy.



=== Alternatives: Woodpecker and Forgejo

you need your own server for these.
i managed to get forgejo up and running in about 40 minutes.

be careful with security!
these things tend to assume you're on a private network,
or that your code is entirely public.

eg: in forgejo to avoid letting the whole internet sign up and rootle around in your ci (not that anyone would care, really, but, you know)

In any case, onto our last chapter!

.Best Practices for CI (including Selenium Tips)
*******************************************************************************

Set up CI as soon as possible for your project::
    As soon as your functional tests take more than a few seconds to run,
    you'll find yourself avoiding running them all.
    Give this job to a CI server,
    to make sure that all your tests are getting run somewhere.
    ((("Selenium", "best CI practices")))
    ((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "tips")))

Optimise for fast feedback::
    CI feedback loops can be frustratingly slow.
    Optimising things to get results quicker is worth the effort.

Set up screenshots and HTML dumps for failures::
    Debugging test failures is easier if you can see what the page looked
    like when the failure occurred.  This is particularly useful for debugging
    CI failures, but it's also very useful for tests that you run locally.
    ((("screenshots")))
    ((("debugging", "screenshots for")))
    ((("HTML", "screenshot dumps")))

Be prepared to bump your timeouts::
    A CI server may not be as speedy as your laptop,
    especially if it's under load, running multiple tests at the same time.
    Be prepared to be even more generous with your timeouts,
    in order to minimise the chance of random failures.
    ((("Flaky tests")))

Take the next step, CD (Continuous Delivery)::
    Once we're running tests automatically,
    we can take the next step which is to automated our deployments
    (when the tests pass). See <<appendix_CD>> for a worked example.
    ((("Continuous Delivery (CD)")))
