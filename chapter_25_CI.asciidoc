[[chapter_25_CI]]
== Continuous Integration (CI)

.Warning, Chapter Update in Progress
*******************************************************************************
ðŸš§ Warning, this chapter is being updated,
and still mostly the 2e version;

Although it's not got many code examples in,
you may find it's a little out of date.

*******************************************************************************


((("Continuous Integration (CI)", id="CI24")))
((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "benefits of")))
As our site grows, it takes longer and longer to run all of our functional tests.
If this continues, the danger is that we're going to stop bothering.

Rather than let that happen, we can automate the running of functional tests
by setting up a "Continuous Integration" or CI server.
That way, in day-to-day development,
we can just run the FT that we're working on at that time,
and rely on the CI server to run all the other tests automatically
and let us know if we've broken anything accidentally.
The unit tests should stay fast enough that we can keep running them every few seconds.

((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "server of choice")))
The CI server of choice these days is called Jenkins.
It's a bit Java, a bit crashy, a bit ugly, but it's what everyone uses,
and it has a great plugin ecosystem, so let's get it up and running.


=== Installing Jenkins

* TODO: update to mention github actions, gitlab etc.

((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "Jenkins installation")))
((("Jenkins", "installation")))
There are several hosted-CI services out there that essentially provide you
with a Jenkins server, ready to go.  I've come across Sauce Labs, Travis,
Circle-CI, ShiningPanda, and there are probably lots more.  But I'm going to
assume we're installing everything on a server we control.

NOTE: It's not a good idea to install Jenkins on the same server as our
    staging or production servers.  Apart from anything else, we may want 
    Jenkins to be able to reboot the staging server!

We'll install the latest version from the official Jenkins apt repo, because
the Ubuntu default still has a few annoying bugs with locale/unicode support,
and it also doesn't set itself up to listen on the public internet by default:


[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
# add jenkins repo to our apt sources
root@server:$ *wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key*

root@server:$ *echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list*

# update and install jenkins
root@server:$ *apt-get update*
root@server:$ *apt-get install jenkins*
----

(Instructions lifted from the https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu[Jenkins site].)


While we're at it, we'll install a few other dependencies:

[role="skipme small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
# remove the default Firefox installed via snap,
# add more reliable "extended support release" version:
root@server:$ *snap remove firefox*
root@server:$ *add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa*
root@server:$ *apt update*
root@server:$ *apt install firefox-esr*

# install the venv modules for the otherwise-broken default system python:
root@server:$ *apt install python3-venv*
----



.Adding Some Swap
*******************************************************************************
Jenkins is quite memory-hungry, and if  you're running this on a small VM
with less than a couple of gigs for RAM, you'll probably find it gets
OOM-killed unless you add some swap:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
root@server:$ *fallocate -l 4G /swapfile*
root@server:$ *mkswap /swapfile*
root@server:$ *chmod 600 /swapfile*
root@server:$ *swapon /swapfile*
root@server:$ *echo "LABEL=swap  /swap.img  swap  defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab*
----

That should be plenty.

*******************************************************************************


=== Configuring Jenkins

((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "Jenkins configuration")))
((("Jenkins", "configuration")))
You should now be able to visit Jenkins at the URL/IP for your server on port `8080`,
and see something like <<jenkin-unlock>>.

[[jenkin-unlock]]
[role="width-75"]
.Jenkins unlock screen 
image::images/jenkins-unlock.png["Jenkins' default unlock screen"]



==== Initial Unlock

The unlock screen is telling us to read a file from disk to unlock the server for first-time use.
I jumped over to a terminal and printed it like this:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
root@server$ *cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword*
----


==== Suggested Plugins for Now

Next we're offered the choice to choose "suggested" plugins.
Suggested ones are fine for now.
(As a self-respecting nerd, our instinct is to hit "customize" immediately,
but I don't think it really bought me anything.)


==== Configuring the Admin User

Next we set up a username and password to log in to Jenkins with; see <<jenkins-user>>.

[[jenkins-user]]
[role="width-75"]
.Jenkins admin user config
image::images/jenkins-admin-user.png["Jenkins screen asking for username and password"]


And once we log in, we should see a welcome screen (<<jenkin-welcome>>).

Adding Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the links for _Manage Jenkins_ -> _Manage Plugins_ -> _Available_.

We'll want the plugins for:

* 'ShiningPanda'
* 'Xvfb'

And hit install (<<installing-plugins>>).

[[installing-plugins]]
[role="width-75"]
.Installing plugins...
image::images/twp2_2404.png["Jenkins installing plugins"]



Telling Jenkins Where to Find Python 3 and Xvfb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need to tell the ShiningPanda plugin where Python 3 is installed 
(usually '/usr/bin/python3', but you can check with a `which python3`):

* _Manage Jenkins_ -> _Global Tool Configuration_

* _Python_ -> _Python installations_ -> _Add Python_ (see <<add-python-to-jenkins>>; it's
  safe to ignore the warning message)

* _Xvfb installation_ -> _Add Xvfb installation_; enter **++/usr/bin++** as the
  installation directory

[[add-python-to-jenkins]]
.Where did I leave that Python?
image::images/twp2_2405.png["Adding Python 3"]


////



Finishing Off with HTTPS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* TODO: review and update this section

To finish off securing your Jenkins instance, you'll want to set up HTTPS, by
getting nginx HTTPS to use a self-signed cert, and proxy requests from port 443
to port 8080. Then you can even block port 8080 on the firewall.  I won't go
into detail on that now, but here are a few links to instructions which I found
useful:

* https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Ubuntu[Official
Jenkins Ubuntu installation guide]

* https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-an-ssl-certificate-on-nginx-for-ubuntu-14-04[How
to create a self-signed SSL certificate]

* http://serverfault.com/questions/250476/how-to-force-or-redirect-to-ssl-in-nginx#424016[How
to redirect HTTP to HTTPS]



Setting Up Our Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "project setup")))((("Jenkins", "project setup")))Now
we've got the basic Jenkins configured, let's set up our project:

* Hit the New Item button.

* Enter 'Superlists' as the name, and then choose "Freestyle project", and hit
  OK.

* Add the Git repo, as in <<choose-git-repo>>.

[[choose-git-repo]]
.Get it from Git
image::images/twp2_2406.png["Setting the git repo"]

* Set it to poll every hour (<<poll-hourly>>; check out the help text here--there are many other options for ways of triggering builds).

[[poll-hourly]]
.Poll GitHub for changes
image::images/twp2_2407.png["Config polling GitHub"]


* Run the tests inside a Python 3 virtualenv.

* Run the unit tests and functional tests separately.  See
  <<virtualenv-buildstep>>.

[[virtualenv-buildstep]]

image::images/twp2_2408.png["Adding Python 3"]



First Build!
~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Jenkins", "first build")))((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "first build")))Hit
"Build Now", then go and take a look at the "Console Output". You
should see something like this:

Ah.  We need Selenium in our virtualenv.


Let's add a manual installation of Selenium to our build 
steps:

[role="skipme"]
----
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py test accounts lists
    pip install selenium fabric3
    python manage.py test functional_tests
----


TIP: Some people like to use a file called 'test-requirements.txt' to specify 
    packages that are needed for the tests, but not the main app.


And hit "Build Now" again. 

Next one of two things will happen.  Either you'll see some error messages
like this in your console output:


[role="skipme"]
----
    self.browser = webdriver.Firefox()
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: 'The browser appears to
have exited before we could connect. The output was: b"\\n(process:19757):
GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion \'sys_page_size == 0\'
failed\\nError: no display specified\\n"' 
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: connection refused
----

Or possibly your build will just hang altogether (that happened to me at
least once).  The reason is that Firefox can't start, because it doesn't
have a display to run on.


Setting Up a Virtual Display So the FTs Can Run Headless
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Jenkins", "virtual display setup", id="Jvirtual23")))((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "virtual display setup", id="CIvirtual24")))((("virtual displays", id="virtdisp24")))As
you can see from the traceback, Firefox is unable to start because the
server doesn't have a display.


There are two ways to deal with this problem. The first is to switch to using
a headless browser, like PhantomJS or SlimerJS.  Those tools definitely have
their place--they're faster, for one thing--but they also have
disadvantages.  The first is that they're not "real" web browsers, so you can't
be sure you're going to catch all the strange quirks and behaviours of the
actual browsers your users use.  The second is that they can behave quite
differently inside Selenium, and often require some rewriting of FT code.

TIP: I would look into using headless browsers as a "dev-only" tool, to speed
    up the running of FTs on the developer's machine, while the tests on the CI
    server use actual browsers.


[role="pagebreak-before"]
The alternative is to set up a virtual display:  we get the server to pretend
it has a screen attached to it, so Firefox runs happily. There are a few tools
out there to do this; we'll use one called "Xvfb" 
(X Virtual Framebuffer)footnote:[Check out https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyVirtualDisplay[pyvirtualdisplay]
as a way of controlling virtual displays from Python.]
because it's easy to install and use, and because it has a convenient Jenkins
plugin (now you know why we installed it earlier).

We go back to our project and hit "Configure" again, then find the section
called "Build Environment".  Using the virtual display is as simple as
ticking the box marked "Start Xvfb before the build, and shut it down after",
as in <<xvfb-tickbox>>.

[[xvfb-tickbox]]
.Sometimes config is easy
image::images/twp2_2409.png["Tickbox saying we want Xvfb"]


The build does much better now:

----

((("", startref="CIvirtual24")))((("", startref="Jvirtual23")))((("", startref="virtdisp24")))Pretty
close!  To debug that failure, we'll need screenshots though.

NOTE: This error was due to the performance of my Jenkins instance--you may see
    a different error, or none at all. In any case, the following tools for taking
    screenshots and dealing with race conditions will come in useful. Read on!



Taking Screenshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "screenshots", id="CIscreen24")))((("screenshots", id="screen24")))((("debugging", "screenshots for", id="DBscreen24")))((("HTML", "screenshot dumps", id="HTMLscreen24")))To
be able to debug unexpected failures that happen on a remote PC, it
would be good to see a picture of the screen at the moment of the failure,
and maybe also a dump of the HTML of the page.  We can do that using some
custom logic in our FT class `tearDown`. We have to do a bit of introspection of
`unittest` internals, a private attribute called `._outcome`, but
this will work:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/functional_tests/base.py (ch23l006)
====
[source,python]
----
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path
[...]
MAX_WAIT = 5

SCREEN_DUMP_LOCATION = Path(__file__).absolute().parent / "screendumps"
[...]

    def tearDown(self):
        if self._test_has_failed():
            if not SCREEN_DUMP_LOCATION.exists():
                SCREEN_DUMP_LOCATION.mkdir(parents=True)
            self.take_screenshot()
            self.dump_html()
        self.browser.quit()
        super().tearDown()

    def _test_has_failed(self):
        # slightly obscure but couldn't find a better way!
        return self._outcome.result.failures or self._outcome.result.errors
----
====


We first create a directory for our screenshots if necessary. Then we 
iterate through all the open browser tabs and pages, and use some Selenium
methods, `get_screenshot_as_file` and `browser.page_source`, for our image and
HTML dumps:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/functional_tests/base.py (ch23l007)
====
[source,python]
----
    def take_screenshot(self):
        path = SCREEN_DUMP_LOCATION / self._get_filename("png")
        print("screenshotting to", path)
        self.browser.get_screenshot_as_file(str(path))

    def dump_html(self):
        path = SCREEN_DUMP_LOCATION / self._get_filename("html")
        print("dumping page HTML to", path)
        path.write_text(self.browser.page_source)
----
====

[role="pagebreak-before"]
And finally here's a way of generating a unique filename identifier, which
includes the name of the test and its class, as well as a timestamp:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.src/functional_tests/base.py (ch23l008)
====
[source,python]
----
    def _get_filename(self, extension):
        timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat().replace(":", ".")[:19]
        return (
            f"{self.__class__.__name__}.{self._testMethodName}-{timestamp}.{extension}"
        )
----
====

You can test this first locally by deliberately breaking one of the tests, with
a `self.fail()` for example, and you'll see something like this:

[role="dofirst-ch21l009"]
----
[...]
.Fscreenshotting to ...goat-book/src/functional_tests/screendumps/MyListsTest.t
est_logged_in_users_lists_are_saved_as_my_lists-[...]
dumping page HTML to ...goat-book/src/functional_tests/screendumps/MyListsTest.
test_logged_in_users_lists_are_saved_as_my_lists-[...]
----

Revert the `self.fail()`, then commit and push:

[role="dofirst-ch21l010"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff*  # changes in base.py
$ *echo "src/functional_tests/screendumps" >> .gitignore*
$ *git commit -am "add screenshot on failure to FT runner"*
$ *git push*
----

And when we rerun the build on Jenkins, we see something like this:

[role="skipme"]
----
screenshotting to /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/Superlists/.../functional_tests/
screendumps/LoginTest.test_login_with_persona-window0-2014-01-22T17.45.12.png

screendumps/LoginTest.test_login_with_persona-window0-2014-01-22T17.45.12.html
----

We can go and visit these in the "workspace", which is the folder Jenkins
uses to store our source code and run the tests in, as in
<<screenshots-in-workspace>>.

[[screenshots-in-workspace]]
[role="width-75"]

If in Doubt, Try Bumping the Timeout!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("", startref="CIscreen24")))((("", startref="screen24")))((("", startref="DBscreen24")))((("", startref="HTMLscreen24")))((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "timeout bumping")))((("Jenkins", "timeout bumping")))Hm.  No obvious clues there.  Well, when in doubt, bump the timeout, as the
old adage goes:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.src/functional_tests/base.py
====
[source,python]
----
MAX_WAIT = 20
----
====

Then we can rerun the build on Jenkins using "Build Now", and confirm it now
works, as in <<outlook-brighter>>.

[[outlook-brighter]]
[role="width-75"]
.The outlook is brighter
image::images/twp2_2412.png["Build showing a recent pass and sun-peeking-through-clouds logo"]

Jenkins uses blue to indicate passing builds rather than green, which is a bit
disappointing, but look at the sun peeking through the clouds:  that's cheery!
It's an indicator of a moving average ratio of passing builds to failing
builds.  Things are looking up!





Running Our QUnit JavaScript Tests in Jenkins with PhantomJS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "QUnit JavaScript tests", id="CIqunit24")))((("Jenkins", "QUnit JavaScript tests with", id="Jqunit24")))((("PhantomJS", id="phantom24")))((("QUnit", id="qunit24")))((("JavaScript testing", "in Jenkins with PhantomJS", secondary-sortas="Jenkins", id="JSTjenkins24")))There's
a set of tests we almost forgot--the JavaScript tests. Currently
our "test runner" is an actual web browser.  To get Jenkins to run them, we
need a command-line test runner.  Here's a chance to use PhantomJS.


Installing node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's time to stop pretending we're not in the JavaScript game.  We're doing
web development.  That means we do JavaScript.  That means we're going to end
up with node.js on our computers.  It's just the way it has to be.

Follow the instructions on the http://nodejs.org/[node.js homepage]. There are
installers for Windows and Mac, and repositories for popular Linux
distros.footnote:[Make sure you get the latest version. On Ubuntu, use the PPA
rather than the default package.]

Once we have node, we can install phantom:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *npm install -g phantomjs-prebuilt*  # the -g means "system-wide".
----

Next we pull down a QUnit/PhantomJS test runner.  There are several out there
(I even wrote a basic one to be able to test the QUnit listings in this book), 
but the best one to get is probably the one that's linked from the
http://qunitjs.com/plugins/[QUnit plugins page]. At the time of writing, its
repo was at https://github.com/jonkemp/qunit-phantomjs-runner.  The only file
you need is 'runner.js'.

You should end up with this:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *tree src/lists/static/tests/*
src/lists/static/tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ qunit-2.0.1.css
â”œâ”€â”€ qunit-2.0.1.js
â”œâ”€â”€ runner.js
â””â”€â”€ tests.html

0 directories, 4 files
----

Let's try it out:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *phantomjs src/lists/static/tests/runner.js src/lists/static/tests/tests.html*
Took 24ms to run 2 tests. 2 passed, 0 failed.
----

Just to be sure, let's deliberately break something:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.src/lists/static/tests/Spec.js (ch23l019)
====
[source,javascript]
----
  it("sense-check our html fixture", () => {
    expect(errorMsg.checkVisibility()).toBe(false);
  });
----
====

Sure enough:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *phantomjs lists/static/tests/runner.js lists/static/tests/tests.html*

Test failed: errors should be hidden on keypress
    Failed assertion: expected: false, but was: true
file://...goat-book/lists/static/tests/tests.html:27:15

Took 27ms to run 2 tests. 1 passed, 1 failed.
----

All right!  Let's unbreak that, commit and push the runner, and then add it to
our [keep-together]#Jenkins# build:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git checkout lists/static/list.js*
$ *git add lists/static/tests/runner.js*
$ *git commit -m "Add phantomjs test runner for javascript tests"*
$ *git push* 
----


Adding the Build Steps to Jenkins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edit the project configuration again, and add a step for each set of 
JavaScript tests, as per <<js-unit-tests-jenkey>>.


[[js-unit-tests-jenkey]]
.Add a build step for our JavaScript unit tests
image::images/new_jenkins_phantomjs_screenshot.png["JS test runner setup"]

You'll also need to install PhantomJS on the server:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
root@server:$ *add-apt-repository -y ppa:chris-lea/node.js*
root@server:$ *apt update*
root@server:$ *apt install nodejs*
root@server:$ *npm install -g phantomjs-prebuilt*
----

And there we are!  A complete CI build featuring all of our tests!

Nice to know that, no matter how lazy I get about running the full test suite
on my own machine, the CI server will catch me.  Another one of the Testing
Goat's agents in cyberspace, watching over us...



More Things to Do with a CI Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "additional uses for")))I've
only scratched the surface of what you can do with Jenkins and CI servers.
For example, you can make it much smarter about how it monitors your repo for
new commits.footnote:[See this reader's 
https://blog.longearsfor.life/blog/2018/07/30/jenkins-and-github-integration-testinggoat-book/[blog post on the topic for example]]

Perhaps more interestingly, you can use your CI server to automate your staging
tests as well as your normal functional tests.  If all the FTs pass, you can
add a build step that deploys the code to staging, and then reruns the FTs 
against that--automating one more step of the process, and ensuring that your
staging server is automatically kept up to date with the latest code.

Some people even use a CI server as the way of deploying their production
releases!


.Tips on CI and Selenium Best Practices
*******************************************************************************

Set up CI as soon as possible for your project::
    ((("Selenium", "best CI practices")))((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "tips")))As
soon as your functional tests take more than a few seconds to run,
    you'll find yourself avoiding running them all. Give this job to a CI
    server, to make sure that all your tests are getting run somewhere.
    

Set up screenshots and HTML dumps for failures::
    ((("screenshots")))((("debugging", "screenshots for")))((("HTML", "screenshot dumps")))Debugging
test failures is easier if you can see what the page looked
    like when the failure occurred.  This is particularly useful for debugging
    CI failures, but it's also very useful for tests that you run locally.

Be prepared to bump your timeouts::
    A CI server may not be as speedy as your laptop, especially if it's under
    load, running multiple tests at the same time.  Be prepared to be even
    more generous with your timeouts, in order to minimise the chance of
    random failures.

Look into hooking up CI and staging::
    ((("Continuous Integration (CI)", "staging and")))((("staging sites", "continuous integrations and")))Tests
that use `LiveServerTestCase` are all very well for dev boxes,
    but the true reassurance comes from running your tests against a real 
    server.  Look into getting your CI server to deploy to your staging server,
    and run the functional tests against that instead.  It has the side benefit
    of testing your automated deploy scripts.((("", startref="CI24")))
