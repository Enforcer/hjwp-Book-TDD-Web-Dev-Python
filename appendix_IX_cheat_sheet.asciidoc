Cheat Sheet
-----------

By popular demand, this "cheat sheet" is loosely based on the little
recap/summary boxes from the end of each chapter.  The idea is to provide a few
reminders, and links to the chapters where you can find out more to jog your
memory. I hope you find it useful!


Initial Project Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ((("cheat sheet", "project setup")))((("Django framework", "set up", "project creation")))Start
with a 'User Story' and map it to a first 'functional test'.

* Pick a test framework&mdash;`unittest` is fine, and options like `py.test`,
  `nose`, or `Green` can also offer some advantages.

* Run the functional test and see your first 'expected failure'.

* Pick a web framework such as Django, and find out how to run
  'unit tests' against it.

* Create your first 'unit test' to address the current FT failure,
  and see it fail.

* Do  your 'first commit' to a VCS like 'Git'.

The Basic TDD Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ((("cheat sheet", "TDD workflow")))((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "overall process of")))Double-loop TDD (<<Double-Loop-TDD-diagram2>>)

* Red, Green, Refactor

* Triangulation

* The scratchpad

* "3 Strikes and Refactor"

* "Working State to Working State"

* "YAGNI"

Moving Beyond Dev-Only Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ((("cheat sheet", "moving beyond dev-only testing")))Start
system testing early. Ensure your components work together: web server,
  static content, database.

* Build a staging environment to match your production environment, and run
  your FT suite against it.

* Automate your staging and production environments:

    - PaaS vs. VPS
    - Fabric
    - Configuration management (Chef, Puppet, Salt, Ansible)
    - Vagrant

* Think through deployment pain points: the database, static files, 
  dependencies, how to customise settings, and so on.

* Build a CI server as soon as possible, so that you don't have to rely
  on self-discipline to see the tests run.

Relevant chapters: <<chapter_11_server_prep>>, <<chapter_25_CI>>


General Testing Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ((("cheat sheet", "testing best practices")))((("testing best practices")))Each
test should test one thing.

* One test file per application code source file.

* Consider at least a placeholder test for every function and class,
  no matter how simple.

* "Don't test constants".

* Try to test behaviour rather than implementation.

* Try to think beyond the charmed path through the code, and think
  through edge cases and error cases.

<<chapter_15_simple_form>>


Selenium/Functional Testing Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use explicit rather than implicit waits, and the interaction/wait pattern.

* Avoid duplication of test code--helper methods in a base class and the
  Page pattern are possible solutions.

* Avoid double-testing functionality. If you have a test that covers a 
  time-consuming process (e.g., login), consider ways of skipping it in 
  other tests (but be aware of unexpected interactions between seemingly
  unrelated bits of functionality).

* Look into BDD tools as another way of structuring your FTs.

Outside-In, Test Isolation Versus Integrated Tests, and Mocking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("cheat sheet", "isolated vs. integrated tests")))Remember
the reasons we write tests in the first place:

* To ensure correctness and prevent regressions
* To help us to write clean, maintainable code
* To enable a fast, productive workflow

And with those objectives in mind, think of different types of tests,
and the trade-offs between them:


Functional tests::
    * Provide the best guarantee that your application really works correctly, from the point of view of the user
    * But: it's a slower feedback cycle
    * And they don't necessarily help you write clean code

Integrated tests (reliant on, for example, the ORM or the Django Test Client)::
    * Are quick to write
    * Are easy to understand
    * Will warn you of any integration issues
    * But: may not always drive good design (that's up to you!)
    * And are usually slower than isolated tests

Isolated ("mocky") tests::
    * Involve the most hard work
    * Can be harder to read and understand
    * But: are the best ones for guiding you towards better design
    * And run the fastest

If you do find yourself writing tests with lots of mocks, and they feel
painful, remember &#x201c;__listen to your tests__&#x201d;â€”ugly, mocky tests may be
trying to tell you that your code could be simplified.
