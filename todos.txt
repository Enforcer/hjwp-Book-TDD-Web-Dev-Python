## switch to postgres

- do it in deploy chaps
- production-readiness really
- install it locally?
- or, put it in a docker container?
- docker-compose??

- consider splitting 23 into two chapters
- figure out how to delete at least one FT?
- spike chap:  start with test of login view.
- pytest
- "switch to flask" appendix


# Appendix ideas

- new appendix on js modules
- appendix where we get rid of model-layer tests?



# OLD TODOS
get rid of staging/live.


mention pdb.set_trace()

add a note re double-checking the django version with django-admin.py --version

build some tests for all the URLs, add to jenkins


# DONE
- count all TR notes per chapter
- python 3.13
- massive updates in 11
- update chap 21 server debugging, do with docker instead?
- requirements.txt chat into 10
