== Forms and Validation

Now that we've got things into production,
we'll spend a bit of time on validation,
a core topic in web development.

There's quite a lot of Django-specific content in this part,
so if you weren't familiar with Django before starting on the book,
you may find that taking a little time to run through the 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/#creating-models[official Django tutorial]
will complement the next few chapters nicely.

With that said, there are lots of good lessons about TDD in general in here too!
So, alternatively, if you're not that interested in Django itself,
don't worry too much about the details,
but instead, look out for the more general principles of testing.
