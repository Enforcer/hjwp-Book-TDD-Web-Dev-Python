== Deploying Our New Code

((("deployment", "procedure for", id="Dpro17")))
It's time to deploy our brilliant new validation code to our live servers.
This will be a chance to see our automated deploy scripts in action for the
second time.

// RITA: A long section where? In the book? Please clarify.
NOTE: At this point I always want to say a huge thanks to Andrew Godwin
    and the whole Django team.
    Up until Django 1.7, I used to have a whole long section,
    entirely devoted to migrations.
    Migrations now "just work", so I was able to drop it altogether.
    I mean yes this all happened nearly ten years ago,
    but still--open source software is a gift.
    We get such amazing things, entirely for free.
    It's worth taking a moment to be grateful, now and again.

=== Staging Deploy


We start with the staging server:

[role="against-server small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*ansible-playbook --user=elspeth -i staging.ottg.co.uk, infra/deploy-playbook.yaml -vv*]
[...]

And run the tests against staging:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=staging.ottg.co.uk python src/manage.py test functional_tests*]
OK
----
// CSANAD: I needed to add `force_source` to the "Import container image on
//         server" task. Otherwise, the server would deploy a container based on
// the old image, even though a new one was successfully created locally (and
// copied as well).
// We changed quite a few things in the source since the last deployment. The
// first error showing up from running the FTs would be a failure to find
// `id_text`. And indeed, if we open the page and inspect the input box
// manually, we can see that it still has its old name, `id_new_item`.
//
// So the Ansible task with the working setup is:
//
//     - name: Import container image on server
//       community.docker.docker_image:
//         name: superlists
//         load_path: /tmp/superlists-img.tar
//         source: load
//         state: present
//         force_source: true
//       become: true


Hooray!

=== Live Deploy

// RITA: Forgive me if this is a newbie question, but will readers understand what you mean by "live"? As in, "live what"? Just making sure that it's clear.
Assuming all is well, we then run our deploy against live:


[role="against-server"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*ansible-playbook --user=elspeth -i www.ottg.co.uk, infra/deploy-playbook.yaml -vv*]
----



=== What to Do If You See a Database Error

Because our migrations introduce a new integrity constraint, you may find
that it fails to apply because some existing data violates that constraint.
// SEBASTIAN: Example might be helpful, like adding not null to a column while having some rows with nulls.

[role="skipme"]
----
sqlite3.IntegrityError: columns list_id, text are not unique
----


At this point you have two choices:

1. Delete the database on the server and try again.
  After all, it's only a toy project!

2. Learn about data migrations.  See <<data-migrations-appendix>>.

==== How to Delete the Database on the Staging Server

Here's how you might do option (1):

[role="skipme"]
----
ssh elspeth@staging.ottg.co.uk rm db.sqlite3
----

The `ssh` command takes an arbitrary shell command to run as its last argument,
so we pass in `rm db.sqlite3`.
We don't need a full path because we keep the sqlite database in elspeth's home folder.

// RITA: Should we make this warning be more forceful by putting it into a "WARNING" box?
TIP: Don't do this in prod!



=== Wrap-Up: git tag the New Release


The last thing to do is to tag the release in our VCS--it's important that
we're always able to keep track of what's live:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git tag -f LIVE*  # needs the -f because we are replacing the old tag
$ *export TAG=`date +DEPLOYED-%F/%H%M`*
$ *git tag $TAG*
$ *git push -f origin LIVE $TAG*
----
// CSANAD: at the time of writing this comment, the `git tag LIVE` in chapter 11
// has been commented out so the -f and the explanation "# needs the -f because
// we are replacing the old tag" is not true.

NOTE: Some people don't like to use `push -f` and update an existing tag,
    and will instead use some kind of version number to tag their releases.
    Use whatever works for you.

And on that note, we can wrap up <<part2>>,
and move on to the more exciting topics that comprise <<part3>>.
Can't wait!

.Deployment Procedure Review
*******************************************************************************

We've done a couple of deploys now, so this is a good time for a little recap:

* Deploy to staging first
* Run our FTs against staging.
* Deploy to live
* Tag the release 

// RITA: For clarity, where do you want the reader to look up CD for background reading?
Deployment procedures evolve and get more complex as projects grow,
and it's an area that can grow hard to maintain,
full of manual checks and procedures,
if you're not careful to keep things automated.
There's lots more to learn about this, but it's out of scope for this book.
Look up "continuous delivery" for some background reading.
